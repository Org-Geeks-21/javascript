# Blocked 
**define block**
`block is a section of code which combines multiple js statments into a group`
- it is also called compound statement
syantax 
{
    //compound statement 
}

**why do we need group statments**
`we need group statments that we can use multiple statments in a place where js excepts only 1 statment`

## block scope

`which variables & functions can access inside a block  are called block scope`

### shadowing in js
`Shadowing is when a local variable overrides a variable from an outer scope with the same name`
