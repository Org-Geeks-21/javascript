javascript is a synchromous single thread execution also called as line by line exception model.

execution contex
it contains two phase 
1 memory creation phase
2 code execution phase
Memory execution phase: it is a phase where each variable parameter provided by a memory for exectution for variable ,it provides a special keyworf "undefined" it isnot a error a special key in js.
for funtion it provides whole code as in memory.
Code execution phase: where the variables changes the value line by line provide by compiler.
Call stack:it is a function which handles everything to manage 
executuion contex like creation,deletion,and control.
Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where declarations of variables,
functions, and classes are conceptually moved to the top of their current scope during the compilation phase, 
before the code is executed.
